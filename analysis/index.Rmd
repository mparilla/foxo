Welcome to the computational lab notebook for a project examining the role of FoxO3 in T-cell lymphoma.

## Data Sources

Downloaded raw data from GEO. In this notebook, the raw data is normalized, and the phenotype data is cleaned and prepared. An expression-set object is created as the last step.

## GSVA

Next we will look at differential expression of FOXO3 targets in individual samples by disease group using GSVA. In this notebook, the expression data is filtered for protein coding genes only, and the probes are collapsed to gene level. Four gene sets containing different FOXO targets are used to investigate patterns of expression among different disease groups.

## Differential gene expression (limma)

We will also investigate the bulk differential gene expression between PTCL samples and control samples using a linear model with limma. The dataset source (3 datasets were combined) will be included as a batch effect variable in the model. Specific genes related to FOXO3 expression and function will be interrogated.
