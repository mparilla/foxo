Microdissection was performed using the Laser Microdissection and Pressure Catapulting (LMPC) technique with an UV-laser beam (PALM). Lymphoma cells were microdissected as single cells or groups of two to ten cells according to their characteristic morphological criteria concerning nuclear shape and diameter, chromatin distribution, nucleoli, and amount and density of cytoplasm.
